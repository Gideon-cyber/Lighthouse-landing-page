            In the beginning of every year I usually bring out my jutter and pen
            and make a list of all the things I want to achieve for that year,
            the list was always a lengthy one, but this year, I had only one
            goal, which way to publicize my brand through the assignment of
            improving the outcomes of business, business owners, the workplace
            and the economy as a whole. How that was my only goal I wondered
            because this was unlike me….but you never can say, the universe was
            watching and listening……
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            I am sure you have so many goals and some of us a few goals that we
            want to achieve in record time and within the period we have left of
            the year 2020……it is still possible!!!!!…
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            I have not come here tonight to motivate or demotivate you…..as an
            HR expert motivation is a key necessity in the workplace, it is only
            the way it is interpreted that many of us have come to dislike…for
            those of us who do not like motivational speakers…….
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            <span
              >Tonight we will be looking at aligning your goals or realigning
              your goals for an improved outcome….regardless of what is ongoing
              at the moment….</span
            >
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up"><span>What are goals?</span></p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a
            group of people envision, plan and commit to achieve.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Goals are specific, close-ended quantifiable objectives with a fixed
            time frame for achieving them. Goals are not wishes, desires or
            dreams although goals are born out of theses terms. Goals can be
            broken down into smaller and short terms objectives, which then
            become checkpoints for making sure that you are on the right track.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Goals represent the decisions we make and the commitments we take in
            order to reach attainment,
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up"><span>Why did you set those goals?</span></p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            <span>To concentrate your energy:</span> By defining what needs to
            be done and setting reasonable time limits for it. <br />
            To <span>give you direction:</span> You decide the destination and
            the time frame and it automatically facilitates the decision
            regarding the route. Once the route is decided, you can check
            whether you are on the right track and on schedule.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up"><span>What is alignment/re-alignment?</span></p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            To Align is to arrange something or a concept or thought process in
            correct relative positions.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            <span>Goal alignment</span> is adjusting your processes to fit your
            overall vision giving considerations to the current state of your
            environment, your audience as well as other internal or external
            factors as it relates to what you have in mind to achieve.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Of cause you know your goals have to be
            <span
              >Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time bound.</span
            >
            That cannot be over stressed.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            <span
              >How do I align my goals for purposeful achievements and improved
              outcome? This is the main question we have come to give answers
              to.</span

              Before we proceed I want to mention that todays live session is

            <span
              >Goals are attached to assignments. Tasks are assigned to
              goals.</span
            >
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            In aligning your goals to improve your outcome, take your goals as
            assignments and tasks to be used as a future reference justified by
            the extreme value you offer. Take each part of your goals as smaller
            tasks to be completed eg like as assignment with submission dates.
            See your goals as an assignment to offer 100% value that people who
            harness your solutions or offerings can refer to your results in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            I used the word justified because in this context it means the
            structured strategies, methods, choices you engage with….. in the
            process of offering extreme value (going the extra mile). This is
            like giving room for your end users or listeners to project into the
            future or bring the future of your work to the present. As it is
            said, your current deliverables exposes or shows your end users,
            clients, customers, listeners what you have done or what you haven’t
            done; steps you have taken and those you didn’t take yesterday. So
            whatever value I am offering you now is the outcome of the degree
            and weight to which I have been able to engage certain experiences
            or information or knowledge in the past. Align your goals to serve
            as a valuable reference for future work today.
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            In tonight’s goal alignment campaign, make your goal a handle that
            will open doors for more assignment /tasks. This is attainable and
            by that you are creating systems around every task you are engaged
            with. Do not take your goals as a one off task, because it means you
            will come back to repeat them, rather create systems around your
            goals, so that you only revisit them for reviews and not to recreate
            them.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            So even in your absence, your goal in the form of value is still
            bringing you results. Eg. A website that sells certain products
            continuously and makes money for the owner, without the immediate or
            repeated input of the owner on a regular basis.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Aligning your goals to become a system gives you precision and
            progress….smart work as they call it. Allow your goals to allow for
            more opportunities for progress and growth. Make your task scalable
            either horizontally (to reach and accommodates more people in
            diversified industries or multiple landscape not directly related to
            your industry for more and robust results for
            <span>progress/expansion</span>) or vertically ( to focus your
            energy in ensuring specified goals are achieved within the confines
            of the vision and not venturing into other competing or
            complementing alternatives for <span>precision</span>).
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            In engaging the horizontal approach to goal alignment, permission to
            access wider opportunities across boards for more “value add on”
            presents itself and is granted.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The horizontal approach to goal alignment is in offering a wider
            more diversified range of solutions interrelated to one another
            without these units competing against itself, but rather
            complimentary to a more solid outcome. Always make your offerings or
            solutions all encompassing; giving yourself room to stretch and
            achieve more.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Promotion is one of the proof of your end goal. Set the right target
            (task) for yourself vise a vise the resources available to you
            currently or the one you can access within your reach (at least
            start or launch from there). Promotion is not a onetime experience;
            It is a continuous opportunity for increased level to achieve
            further success.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Celebrate small steps towards your promotion. Align your goals to
            fit towards your mental, financial and physical or spiritual
            promotion. Also re-align your minds capacity to always be on the
            win-win pedestrial not on the lose-win, or lose-lose ….WIN-WIN
            ALWAYS
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            To align your goals for more, participate in the process that
            produces the result your vision requires. Do not be aloof of what’s
            going on in the line of duty…be deeply involved in the entire
            process of achieving your goals. Make it a point of duty to
            produce…produce….and keep produce….don’t just wait at the end for
            the outcome, plan, prioritize, prepare and participate in
            contributing to the entire goals/task/assignment for improved
            outcomes
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            In conclusion to avoid or stop every form of shadow boxing going
            forward, apply these principles…in your career, business and life.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Remember, it is in the application that you improve your outcome not
            only in hearing this things.
          </p>
